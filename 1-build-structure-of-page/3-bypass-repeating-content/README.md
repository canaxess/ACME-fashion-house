# 3. Bypass Repeating Content
Page content which repeats across multiple pages is a challenge for keyboard and screen reader users if there is no way to avoid the content. If a user is forced to tab through the same set of links to reach new content every time a page has loaded in can quickly become a frustrating and fatiguing process.
