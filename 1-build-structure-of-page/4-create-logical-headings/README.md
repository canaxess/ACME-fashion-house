# 4. Create Logical Headings
Headings on a webpage are much more than a large and prominent font. Headings provide a visual hierarchy that breaks up content and allows a user to easily scan the page. However, unless the heading structure has been coded correctly the page hierarchy will be meaningless to non-sighted users.

## Activity
1. Apply as many heading elements as required to text which you think should be a heading

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
