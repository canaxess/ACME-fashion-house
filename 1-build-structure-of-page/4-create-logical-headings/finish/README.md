# 4. Create Logical Headings
Headings on a webpage are much more than a large and prominent font. Headings provide a visual hierarchy that breaks up content and allows a user to easily scan the page. However, unless the heading structure has been coded correctly the page hierarchy will be meaningless to non-sighted users.

## Activity
1. Apply as many heading elements as required to text which you think should be a heading

## Solution
Headings elements are used to better reflect the hierarchy of the page content:
* One `<h1>` element (hidden with CSS) is added
* Several `<h2>` elements added with `<h3>` when necessary
