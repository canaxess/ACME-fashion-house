# 1. Create Descriptive Page Titles
A page title is one way a user can orientate themselves to a website and can be used to describe the topic or purpose of the page. Using title text can also assist a screen reader user and should give them enough information to decide whether they wish to continue reading the page.

## Activity
1. Choose a more descriptive page title as the current title is unclear

## Solution
* The page title has been changed to **ACME Fashion House** as it is the homepage, alternative title text could also be **ACME Fashion House home**.

### Code
```html
<title>ACME Fashion House</title>
```
