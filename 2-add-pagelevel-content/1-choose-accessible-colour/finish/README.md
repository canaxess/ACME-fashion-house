# 1. Choose Accessible Colours
Colour contrast is really important for users with visual impairments. A colour contrast impairment can affect a user's ability to discern links, buttons or interactive elements on a page and make it difficult to differentiate the foreground content from the background if a poor contrast between colours is chosen.

## Activity
1. Identify if the heading colour "Top month Sellers" is an accessible colour when compared against the background

## Outcome
The colour `#D3D3D3` is a fail for both large and regular text on [WCAG 2.1 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

The Red, Green, Blue slides on the Colour Contrast Analyser tool can be adjusted to darken the colour. An acceptable colour for the text could `#000000` (Black) or `#757675` which is a darker version of the gray.
