# 4. Add Keyboard And Mouse Focus
The often-overlooked way of navigating a website is via the keyboard. All interactions may be accessible from the keyboard, but if users can’t see where the screen focus is when navigating, it makes it that much harder to know where they are on the page.

## Activity
1. Create a consistent mouse and keyboard focus effect for the navigation links<br>*Hint: this involves editing the CSS file `focus.css`*

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Alter the file `focus.css` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
