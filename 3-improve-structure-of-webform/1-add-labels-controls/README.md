# 1. Add Labels To Controls
Nearly all form elements need a label. Without a label form controls that receive keyboard focus will only announce the type of control to the screen reader user not what type of data is required. When a label doesn’t provide enough information describing what to enter, more errors are likely.

## Activity
1.	Programmatically associate all labels to the form controls _Title_, _First Name_, _Last Name_, _Email Address_

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
